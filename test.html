    <h1>MSA Viewer</h1>

    <p>This is multiple sequence alignment (MSA) results viewer for MSA results in ClustalW format. By entering the job
        ID for a recent (within the last 7 days) MSA, the alignment results as well as some unique statistics can be
        viewed. MSA tools which provide a ClustalW format include: Clustal Omega, MAFFT*, MUSCLE**, and T-Coffee.</p>

    <p class="small">
        *The default output format for MAFFT is Pearson/FASTA. Please ensure the MSA tool is run with the output format
        set to ClustalW.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
        **This viewer was originally designed for MUSCLE results, but can accept appropriately format results of the
        other 3 tools as well.
    </p>
