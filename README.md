# MSA Viewer

AS.410.712 Advanced Practical Computer Concepts for Bioinformatics
::Final Project :: Katharina Gees

## Getting Started
In order to use the MSA viewer, you will need a recent (within the 
last 7 days) multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from EMBL-EBI. There
are multiple MSA tools available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/,
however only 4 of them generate results in ClustalW format which is
required for this viewer. These are the 4 tools: Clustal Omega, MAFFT*,
MUSCLE, and T-Coffee.

**Please note that the default output format for MAFFT is Pearson/
FASTA.*
